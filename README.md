# discord_chat_replay
Replay a Discord chat log in video by generating subtitles to overlay.

It was used to make
[this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_8F6gOG0GA).

This project is currently "not general at all". In particular, you have to use
a specific Discord messages downloader, and has tons of hard-coded information
about the original use-case.
